# Creating a Grouped Product

In Liferay Commerce, a Grouped Product consists of two or more Products from a Catalog that are sold together as a pre-defined set, either for customer convenience or to offer a special price. Grouped Products are tracked in inventory and can include any type of Products (i.e., Simple, Grouped, Virtual). For example, consider a wholesale furniture distributor. While furniture items can be purchased separately, the distributor can group related products together into a furniture set, either for customer convenience, or to offer special deals.

To get started, [create](#create-a-grouped-product) a Grouped Product and [add](#adding-product-entries) new Product entries to it. Then, configure the Grouped Product and SKU.

<!--TASK: Insert admonition delineating the difference between Grouped Products and Product bundles. -->

## Prerequisites

Before creating a Grouped Product, ensure that the following conditions have been met:

1. All Products you want to add to the Grouped Product have been created in the Catalog.

    * All SKUs have been generated.
    * All prices have been set.

1. Each Product has sufficient inventory.

## Create a Grouped Product

Follow these steps to create a Grouped Product:

1. Open the *Global Menu*, click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Product Management* &rarr; *Products*.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)), and select *Grouped*.

1. Enter a *name*, and select the desired *Catalog*.

1. Click *Submit*.

This creates a new Grouped Product entity in the selected Catalog with a single SKU, *default*. Grouped Products can be configured in the same way as other Product types (e.g., SEO, Options, Inventory Rules). See [Product Configuration Reference](../products/product-configuration-reference.md) for more information about general Product settings.

## Adding Product Entries

Follow these steps to add entries to the Grouped Product:

1. Click on the *Grouped* tab.

1. Click the Add button (![Add Button](../../../images/icon-add.png)), and select the desired Product entries.

1. When finished, click *Add*.

The selected Product entries are immediately associated with the Grouped Product and are listed in the *Grouped* tab. You can edit each entry to determine its *quantity* and *priority*.

Once you've created the Grouped Product and associated other Products with it, set a base price for the default [SKU](./../products/adding-skus-to-your-products.md) to make it available for purchase. This price is used in place of each Product's individual price.
